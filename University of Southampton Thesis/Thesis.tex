\begin{abstract}
  Microfluidics is a constantly growing field of research finding applications in a diverse range of subjects
  such as materials science, chemistry and across the life sciences. This is due to many advantageous attributes
  that microfluidics enjoys, namely small sample volumes which contribute to waste reduction and reduced cost of
  experimentation; highly controllable local environments that enable very precise investigation of changes in
  systems to stimuli; rapid prototyping techniques meaning make, test, tweak cycles can be run more than once
  in a typical day; ease of parallelisation makes gathering statistically significant data much easier without
  the need to repeat experiments for days at a time; and ease of automation increases precision and repeatability

  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely applied technique in chemistry and the life sciences.
  Its non-invasive and non-destructive nature makes it ideal to study living, or mass limited samples. However,
  it is limited by having to have an extremely homogenous magnetic field as well as the low sensitivities possible in a
  typical experiment.

  This thesis describes methods for integrating these two fields. Some NMR experiments being ‘miniaturised’ to
  be performed ‘on-chip’ as well as microfluidic concepts that have been engineered to be compatible with NMR
  techniques. These techniques do not seek to replace established methods of microfluidic analysis such as mass
  spectrometry or fluorescence spectroscopy but could be used to compliment these techniques as an additional
  method of extracting data from the system.
