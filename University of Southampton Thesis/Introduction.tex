\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Microfluidics}

\begin{itemize}
  \item What is it?
Microfluidics is a broad term that covers a wide variety of research, it is classified by the analysis of small
volumes of liquids usually nL to $\mu$l in doing so it offers a numerous benefits. Microfluidics chiefly uses
Lab-on-a-chip (LoC) devices or the more archaic term micro total analysis system (ÂµTAS) to perform experiments. An LoC is
a device capable of scaling labratory functions down to a chip-format. The size of this device ranges from a few mm$^2$ to a few cm$^2$
and contain very small volumes of fluid typically nano to micro litres. The small 
volumes involved make it ideal to study mass limited samples, as in macromolecular chemistry or protein classification
in biochemistry whilst reducing the costs associated with these experiments. Microfludic systems possess precisely defined
geometry of paths which enable control of mixing and seperation of fluids, this also lends itself well to the control of the
microenvironment with the device. Devices usually consist of cheap fabrication materials such as polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) or polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA).
  \item Why do we want to use it?
- The fine control of reaction conditions allows for precise investigations of reaction kinetics
- Currently, NMR not widely used in microfluidics and can be used to provide extra information on the system
can also be used in conjunction with existing methods of analysis in microfluidics (mass spec, fluorescence)
as NMR leaves sample unpeturbed, perfect for \textit{in situ} monitoring of living systems. Coupling
could take the form of a longitudinal NMR metabolomic study of cells whilst monitoring specific protein
expresison with fluorescence.
  \item Who uses it?(What has been done in literature?)
- need help with this, maybe discuss with Marcel? Manz et al 1990 - breif summary of paper, why is it important?
  \item Goal - combination without compromise (MF + $\mu$NMR)
- We'd like to incorporate funcitonal microfluidic experiments with high resolution NMR spectroscopy. In
such a way that the validity either part, microfluidic or magnetic resonance, remains intact. In that
way not ony would NMR become a more widely used tool for the microfluidic toolbox it could also
become a valuable attachment to compliment existing tools. However, this combination
is not without significant challenges. Firstly, a probe capable of $\mu$NMR must be designed, that fits
with a removable chip for ease of parellelisation. This probe must be of comparable performance
to existing probes, to maintain validity, and work with existing magnets and spectrometers. Secondly, the
chip, and any functionality that it possesses, must fit into the bore of the magnet which is typically around
38 mm in diameter. Thirdly, materials used in construction of the chip must be non-magnetic and susceptibility
matched to the sample of interest so it can enable high resolution NMR. Lastly, the device used must be
bio-compatible as most applications in microfluidics are in some way biological.
  \item Motivation: By combining these two fields and harnassing the 'best of both worlds' approach
new insight and analysis is available. Having quantitative, system-level information in a
a single or just a few scans could benefit a wide variety of experiments. Enabling microfluidic
NMR also provides the oppurtunity to scan mass-limited samples such as those commonly found in
ligand binding reactions or macrocyclic chemistry.


\end{itemize}

\section{NMR theory}

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) theory can be described using two approaches:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The classical approach, in which the the nuclei are thought of as small bar magnets which
  rotate in 3D space. Experiments can be described be approxiamating the net magnetisation as a
  vector in 3D space.
  \item The quantum mechanical approach, in which each spin in the system is in a distinct quantised state.
  Operators are used to describe the state of a system as a whole. Experiments are described by propagating
  these operators.
\end{enumerate}

The theory described in this chapter is mainly from \citep{RN135,RN136} and is intended to provide sufficient background
knowledge in order for the reader to understand later chapters.

\subsection{Classical NMR}

\subsubsection{Spin}

Nuclei, often modelled as a clump of neutrons and protons surrounded by electrons at
the centre atoms, have a property reffered to as spin.

In fact, nuclear spin is an intrinsic property of the nucleus and can take half or whole
integer values, including $0$. In this thesis we will be mainly concerned about one spin-
1/2 nucleus, the proton ($\ce{^{1}H}$), with another spin-1/2 nucleus \ce{^{13}C} making
sparse appearences. Just like in this thesis, $\ce{^{13}C}$ only has an $\approx{1}\%$
abundance in nature with the other $\approx{99}\%$ $\ce{^{12}C}$ having a spin-$0$
nucleus.

All spin-1/2 nuclei possess a magnetic dipole moment and behave rather like small bar magnets in that, when placed in an external magnetic field they have a tendency to align
with the field. In NMR this external field is called $B_0$, and is orientated along the
$z$-axis.

\subsubsection{Population}\label{Population}

In a magnetic field a spin-1/2 nucles has two energy levels with a separation that is proportional to the strength of the magentic field a schematic is show in \fig{fig:EnergySplit}. We label these levels $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=5cm,keepaspectratio]{EigenStateLevel.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Energy level and $\Delta~E$ of the two energy levels for a spin-1/2 nucleus}
  \label{fig:EnergySplit}
\end{figure}

When measuring a group of spins each spin can exist in either the $\alpha$ or $\beta$ state and overall the spins have a slight preference for the lower energy state, $\alpha$. This preference can be quantified by calculating the difference in populations ($P$) which at thermal equilibrium is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Boltzmann}
  \frac{P_{\beta}}{P_{\alpha}} = \text{exp}\{\frac{-\Delta{E}}{k_B T}\}
\end{equation}

where $P_{\beta}/P_{\alpha}$ is the population ratio between the states, $k_B$ is Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The polarisation, $p$, of a system of
spin-1/2 nuclei is
\begin{equation}
  p = \frac{P_\alpha - P_\beta}{P_\alpha + P_\beta}
\end{equation}

For a system in an NMR experiment which typically operates at 298$K$ and
a field of 14.1 T the polarisation level is circa $10^5$ meaning That the spins are aligned weakly in the same direction as the magnetic field. It is this small polarisation that gives rise to the NMR signal and why NMR is famed for sensitivity
issues. One possible solution to this will be described in a later chapter.

\subsubsection{Nuclear spin precession}

When placed in a magnetic field, the nuclei will precess around the axis of the field at a rate known as the larmour frequency defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:larmour}
  \omega_j^0 = -\gamma_jB_0
\end{equation}

where $\gamma_j$ is the gyromagnetic ratio for a nucleus, $j$. The gyromagnetic ratio is
typically $10$s of MHz T$^{-1}$ that give larmour frequencies in the $100$s of MHz in an NMR
experiment.

\subsubsection{Magnetisation as a vector}

The net magnetic moment of a spin ensemble can be modelled by a 3D vector that can rotates in space. The essence of this is shown in \fig{fig:VectorFig}. Magnetisation is intially taken to be orientated along the $z$-axis, this is called longitudinal magnetisation. It is then rotated into the $xy$-plane which is called transverse
magnetisation that then precesses about the $z$-axis.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{VectorFig.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Magnetisation shown as a vector in red, at equilibrium, is orientated on the $z$-axis. A $pi$/2
  pulse rotates the vector to the $xy$-plane where it begins to precess around the $z$-axis.}
  \label{fig:VectorFig}
\end{figure}

How this vector changes in a magnetic field is described using the Bloch equations\citep{Bloch:1946hk}. These are a group of differential equations that
describe how the magnetisation vector components evolves in time in the
presence of orthogonal magnetic fields.
\begin{align}\label{eqn:Bloch}
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=\quad\gamma(M_y(t)B_z(t)-M_z(t)B_y(t))\\
  \frac{dM_y(t)}{dt}\quad=\quad\gamma(M_z(t)B_x(t)-M_x(t)B_z(t))\\
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=\quad\gamma(M_x(t)B_y(t)-M_y(t)B_x(t))
\end{align}
where $M_a$ is the magnetisation vector component along the $a$-axis, $B_a$ is the
magnetic field along the $a$-axis, and $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio as described before.

In the case of processing magnetisation around the $z$-axis, here denoted $B_0$, the
Bloch equations can be written as
\begin{align}
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\gamma~B_0M_y(t)\\
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad-\gamma~B_0M_x(t)\\
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad0
\end{align}
these have the solutiion
\begin{align}
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\cos(\omega^0t)M_x(0) + \sin(\omega_0t)M_y(0)\\
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\cos(\omega^0t)M_y(0) + \sin(\omega_0t)M_x(0)\\
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad0
\end{align}
where $\omega^0$ is the larmour frequency from \eqn{eqn:larmour}.

\subsubsection{Pulses and rotating frame}

\subparagraph{Rotating frame}

The field, $B_0$, of a regular NMR experiment is many Tesla, giving precession
frequencies of hundreds of megahertz. These frequencies correspond to radio frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum. Considering these precessing spins
it can be useful to change from a static frame to a rotating frame of reference.

The general case is when the rotating frame is at frequency $\omega_{rot}$, in this
frame, the larmour frequency will appear to be ($\omega - \omega_{\text{rot}})$. This is called the offset,$\Omega$ and is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \Omega = \omega -\omega_{\text{rot}}
\end{equation}

It follows from this, that if the apparent larmour frequency in the rotating frame is different from that in the static frame, it must also be the case that the apparent magnetic field in the rotating frame must be different from the applied
field. We can use \eqn{eqn:larmour} to compute the apparent magnetic field, $B^{\text{red}}_0$:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:redB}
  \Omega =& -\gamma~B^{\text{red}}_0\\
\text{hence}\quad~B^{\text{red}}_0 =& \frac{\Omega}{\gamma}
\end{align}
this apparent magnetic field in the rotating frame is called the reduced field.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=7cm, keepaspectratio]{B1Bred.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{In the rotating frame the effective field, $B_{\text{eff}}$, is the vector sum of the reduced field,
  $B_{\text{red}}$ and the $B_1$ field. $\theta$ is the tilt angle defined between $B_{\text{red}}$ and $B_{\text{eff}}$}
  \label{fig:BMag}
\end{figure}


\subparagraph{Pulses}

In NMR experiments pulses are used to manipulate magnetisation in order to obtain a signal. A pulse can be
thought of as a magnetic field oscillating at the frequency of the rotating frame
applied in the $xy$-plane in order to induce procession of the magnetisation. This magnetic field is labelled $B_1$ and is much smaller in amplitude than $B_0$, the actual applied field.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SpinRelaxation.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A) A graphical representation used to describe a pulse sequence, the width and height of the block
  refer to the power and duration of pulse respectively, the line represents the acquisition of signal. B)(1) The
  magnetisation lies in equilibrium along the $z$-axis. (2)  The $\pi/2_y$ pulse rotates the magnetisation around the $y$-axis. (3) The magnetisation precesses in the $xy$-plane around the $z$-axis and returns to thermal equilibrium}
  \label{fig:Pulse}
\end{figure}

In the static frame, the magnetisation is processing around $B_0$ at the larmour frequncy, so a relatively weak $B_1$ applied along the $y$-axis, for example, would do little to peturb it, given the effective magnetic field, $B^{\text{eff}}_0$, is calculated by:
\begin{equation}
  B^{\text{eff}}_0 = \sqrt{(B_1)^2+(B_0)^2}
\end{equation}
the much larger $B_0$ dominates here, however, if we apply the $B_1$ in the rotating
frame this becomes
\begin{equation}
  B^{\text{eff}}_0 = \sqrt{(B_1)^2+(B^{\text{red}}_0)^2}
\end{equation}
and using \eqn{eqn:redB} as $\omega_{\text{rot}}\rightarrow\omega$, $\Omega\rightarrow0$ and $B^{red}_0\rightarrow0$ so by making the offset small, or zero, the effective field
then lies close to the $xy$-plane and so the magnetisation will be rotated down
from $z$ which is what we'd like to acheive for our experiments.

The key, is that although $B_0$ is much larger than $B_1$, we can still affect magnetisation using $B_1$ by making it oscillate close to the larmour frequency
this is the phenomena of resonance. The angle between $B^{\text{red}}_0$ and $B^{\text{eff}}$ is
called the tilt angle, $\theta$. It can be seen from \fig{fig:BMag} that:
\begin{equation}
\sin(\theta) = \frac{B_1}{B_{\text{eff}}}\qquad\cos(\theta) = \frac{B^{red}_0}{B_{\text{eff}}}\qquad\tan(\theta) = \frac{B_1}{B^{\text{red}}_0}
\end{equation}

These radio frequency (rf) pulses are useful because they can be used to address spins at a specific larmour
frequncy. By applying an rf pulse on resonance with $\ce{^1H}$ we can manipulate the magnetisation of the nuclei whislt not affecting other spins (e.g. $\ce{^13C}$) contained in the sample.

\subsubsection{Fourier Transform NMR}

In this section we will examine how we can produce an NMR spectrum from the magnetisation of a sample
using the rf pulses we introduced.

In NMR we use a pulse sequence to describe the intensity and duration of pulses used in an
experiment, shown in \fig{fig:Pulse}. The rf pulse, $B_1$, is a $\pi/2$ pulse in the $y$-axis, followed by a signal
acquisition. This pulse tips the magnetisation into the $xy$-plane, and if the pulse length is much less than the
precession period (we will assume so), the spins begin to precess freely around the $z$-axis at the larmour
frequency, $\omega_0$, until they return to the $z$-axis through a process described in \ref{Relaxation}.

In a usual NMR experiment the signal is inductally detected. The oscillation of the spins in the sample induces
a current in the pick-up coils around the sample, which is detected, amplified and transformed into a spectrum.
The resulting free induction decay (FID) is typically an exponentionally decaying sinusoidal function. The signal
produced from this can be written as:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:signal}
  S(t) =& \sum_l s_l(t) \\
  s_l(t) =& a_l\text{exp}\{-(i\omega_l+\lambda_l)t\} = a_l(\cos(\omega_lt) + i\sin(\omega_0t))\text{exp}\{-\lambda_l~t\}
\end{align}
where $S(t)$ is the total signal from from the sample and $s_l$ are the individual spins. Each spin has an amplitude, $a_l$, and an associated decay constant, $\lambda_l$. The nature of which will be discussed in \ref{Relaxation} section. Exponential to trigometric function conversion
is done according to Euler's formula: $\text{exp}\{ix\} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$.

$S(t)$ is easy to evaluate and interpret if it originates from one spin or a group of spins precessing
at precisely the same frequency, however, if there are more spins in the sample processing at different frequencies
the FID becomes extremely hard to interpret on its own.

We can clear this picture up however by employing a Fourier transform. This comverts the time-domain data
into the frequncy-domain, such that the total signal in the frequency domain, $S(\omega)$ is the sum of all individual spin signals in the frequency, $S_l(\omega)$:
\begin{equation}
  S(\omega) = \sum_l S_l(\omega)
\end{equation}
This allows us to clearly see which resonances are possessed by our spins in the sample. To
perform a Fourier transform we must do the following:
\begin{equation}
  S_l(\omega) = \int_{0}^{\infty}s_l(t)\text{exp}\{-i\omega t\}dt
\end{equation}
and using \eqn{eqn:signal} can be rewritten:
\begin{equation}
  S_l(\omega) = a_l\int_{0}^{\infty}\text{exp}\{(-i(\omega+\omega_l)+\lambda_l t\}dt
\end{equation}
sometimes written more concisely as:
\begin{equation}
  S(\omega) = \mathcal{F}\{S(t)\}(\omega)
\end{equation}
where $S(t)$ is the signal for the time domain (FID) and $S(\omega)$ is the signal in the frequency domain.

The Fourier transform of our general case is:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}\{S(t)\}(\omega) = a_l\frac{1}{\lambda_l + i(\omega - \omega_l)}
\end{equation}
which is Lorentzian function centered at $\omega_l$ with peak width parameter $\lambda_l$.

The NMR signal represented in the frequency domain is a spectrum. It is usually many peaks
indicating different resonance frequencies of spins in the sample. In the next
section we will discuss chemical shift and J-coupling. Two additional effects that when combined
with larmour frequencies already discussed forms the NMR spectrum as we know it.

\subsubsection{Chemical Shift and J-coupling}

In a molecule, nuclei are surrounded by clouds of electrons which can shield, or de-sheild, it
from the effects of the external field $B_0$.

The chemical shielding factor, $sigma$, shifts the resonance frequency of the nuclear spin. We
can now include it in \eqn{eqn:larmour}:
\begin{equation}
  \omega_j^0 = -\gamma_jB_0(1-\sigma)
\end{equation}
this chemical shielding is specific to each nucleus in the molecule. It is possible
for two or more nuclei to share the same factor. We refer to these as being chemically equivalent.

The shielding is often around $10^-6$ for $\ce{^1H}$. When plotting and examining spectra
it is would not be useful to use absolute frequecies, as discussed they are regualarly in the hundreds of MHz,
whereas the differences in peaks might only be kHz or less. To combat this we use a relative frequency scale
called chemical shift, $\delta$, it is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \delta = \frac{\omega_j-\omega^\text{ref}_j}{\omega^\text{ref}_j}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_j$ is the precession frequency of the nucleus of interest, and $\omega^\text{ref}_j$ is the precession
frequency of a reference nuclei. $\delta$ is a dimentionless number, unaffected by magnetic field strength, it often
small compared to the size of the field and is reported in parts per million (ppm).

In addition to the external $B_0$ field, the nuclear spins are also affected by the magnetic fields generated
by neighboring spins. These magnetic fields are mediated by the electrons in the chemical bonds. This is refered to as
spin-spin couling or $J$-coupling and gives rise to peak splittings in spectra. These splittings, and therefore the values of $J$-couplings, range from a few Hz to a thousand Hz typically. It is an important factor and is icorperated
in the quatum description on NMR in \ref{Hamiltonian}.

Both of these, $\sigma$ and $J$-couplings, are tensors this means they depend on the orientation of the molecule
and the spin with respect to the magetic field. In liquids, however, tumble rapidly compared to the timescale
of an NMR experiment. This averages the interactions resulting in a scalar quantity for each.

There are additional effects the nuclear spins experience, for example, dipole-dipole coupling which
is a through space spin-spin coupling, and quadrapole coupling where there are spins with >1/2 values
however, these are not relevant to this work.

\subsubsection{Relaxation}\label{Relaxation}

The last part needed to complete our classical understanding of NMR is relaxation. Relaxation is the process
of the spin returning to the thermal equilibrum. The thermal equilibrium of spin-1/2 nuclei in a
magnetic field is the bulk magnetisation vector pointing in the direction of the $B_0$ field.

In this system there are two forms of relaxation, $T_1$ and $T_2$. $T_1$ is the longitudal relaxation time
constant and $T_2$ is the transverse relaxation time constant the difference between them is shown in \fig{fig:t1t2}.
$T_1$ is the rate constant that governs the return of magnetisation to the $z$-axis from the $xy$-plane. $T_2$ on
the other hand is the time constant that governs the return of magnetisation to equilibrium in the $xy$-plane.
It is more accurate to say that $T_1$ is the relaxation rate constant for populations, and $T_2$ is the relaxation
rate constant coherences, in the density operator (discussed in \ref{Quantum}). But this is incompatible
with the classical description of NMR.

We can now complete the Bloch equations from \eqn{eqn:Bloch}:
\begin{align}
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\gamma(M_y(t)B_z(t)-M_z(t)B_y(t)) - \frac{M_x(t)}{T_2}\\
  \frac{dM_y(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\gamma(M_z(t)B_x(t)-M_x(t)B_z(t)) - \frac{M_y(t)}{T_2}\\
  \frac{dM_zt)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\gamma(M_x(t)B_y(t)-M_y(t)B_x(t)) - \frac{M_z(t)-M_0}{T_1}
\end{align}
in order to derive $M_{xy}$ we assume the following:
\begin{equation}
  M_{xy} = M_x + iM_y\qquad\text{and} B_{xy} = B_x + iB_y
\end{equation}
After some algebra we obtain:
\begin{align}
  \frac{dM_xy(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad-i\gamma(M_{xy}(t)B_z(t)-M_z(t)B_{xy}(t)) - \frac{M_{xy}(t)}{T_2}\\
  \frac{dM_y(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad~i~\frac{\gamma}{2}(M_{xy}(t)\overline{B_{xy}}(t)-\overline{M_{xy}}(t)B_z(t)) - \frac{M_y(t)}{T_2}\\
\end{align}
where $\overline{M_{xy}} = M_x - iM_y\qquad\text{and} \overline{B_{xy}} = B_x - iB_y$
solving these gives:
\begin{align}
  M_z(t) =& M_{z,\text{eq}} - (M_{z,\text{eq}}-M_z(0))\text{exp}\{\frac{-t}{T_1}\}\\
  M_{xy}(t) =& M_{xy}(0)\text{exp}\{\frac{-t}{T_2}\}
\end{align}

\begin{figure}
  \center{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{T1T2.pdf}}
  \caption{A) a magnetisation vector precesses in the $xy$-plane, eventually returning to equilibrium.
  B) A plot of the magnetisation along $z$-axis (yellow) and the $x$-axis (blue) during the relaxation.}
  \label{fig:t1t2}
\end{figure}

Relaxation occurs when the spins exchange energy with their surroundings. They do
this when local magnetic fields, usually caused by the motion of surrounding molecules, oscillate
near the larmour frequency of the relaxing spin. These oscillating fields can be thought of
as local RF pulses we discussed earlier, the key difference is that they only affect a few spins
and not the sample as a whole. Essentially relaxation is an energy exchange between the
spins and the molecules surrounding them. This is the origin of the original name for longitudal
relaxation - spin-lattice relaxation.



\subsection{Quantum description of NMR}\label{Quantum}

In this chapter, I will introduce the the quantum description of NMR. Including how
we use operators and superoperators to understand how states change under different conditons and how the energies of the system can be extracted.

\subsubsection{Nuclear Spin}

Nuclear spin can be treated as a type of angular momentum. Spin angular momentum can be characterized by its total
angular momentum, and the angular momentum with respect to a reference axis (usually z).  Denoted by $\hat{I}$
it is comprised of a magnitude, $\lvert\hat{I}\rvert$, and a direction, $m_I$.
The magnitude is given by
\begin{equation}
  \lvert\hat{I}\rvert = \hbar\sqrt{I(I+1)}
\end{equation}
where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $I = 0,\frac{1}{2},1,\dots$. The projection of $\hat{I}$ in
the $z$ direction, $\hat{I}_{z}$, is given by
\begin{equation}
  \hat{I}_{z} = m_I\hbar
\end{equation}
$m_{I}$ can take integer values from $-I$ to $+I$ shown in \fig{fig:Projection}

For the commonly occuring case of a spin-1/2 nucleus, $I=1/2$ and $m_I = Â±1/2$ and if we were to measure $\hat{I}_z$ we would get a value of  with an associated probability depending which state the system is in. Indicating the possible measurement outcomes for $\hat{I}_z$ are $Â±\frac{\hbar}{2}$.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth,height=5cm,keepaspectratio]{StateProjection.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{The projection of two states in a spin 1/2 nucleus (red arrow) with the magnitudes indicated (black arrow)}
  \label{fig:Projection}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Spin States}\label{SpinStates}

If a spin-1/2 nucleus is placed in a magnetic field (taken to be oriented along $z$) it can be represented using two basis states.
State one has $I = 1/2$, $m_I = 1/2$ and State two has $I = 1/2$, $m_I = -1/2$. We denote these as $\ket{I,m_I}$\citep{dirac_1939}, for simplicity we omit the $I$ and are left with
$\ket{m_I}$. For the special case of a spin-1/2 the two states are known as zeeman states denoted by $\ket{\alpha}$ and $\ket{\beta}$. Where the $\ket{\alpha}$ state has angular momentum +1/2 and $\ket{\beta}$ has -1/2.

The zeeman states take the following form:

\begin{equation}
  \ket{\alpha} = \begin{pmatrix}
    1\\
    0
\end{pmatrix}
 \ket{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
   0\\
   1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

bras are also defined by taking the conjugate transpose of the ket, $\ket{\alpha}^{\dagger} =
\bra{\alpha}$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \bra{\alpha} = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
  \bra{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The state, $\ket{\psi}$, of a two level system can now be completely decribed in this basis
as the linear combination of the basis states:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:zeeman}
  \ket{\psi} = c_1\ket{\alpha} + c_2\ket{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
    c_1\\
    c_2
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \bra{\psi} = c_1^*\bra{\alpha} + c_2^*\ket{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
    c_1^* & c_2^*
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

These are normalised such that $c_1c_1^* + c_2c_2^* = 1$.

To complete the picture the sates must me orthonormal. Orthonormality between states exists if
if the inner product of the basis states $\ket{r_i} ~\text{and}~ \ket{r_j}$ satisifies the following conditions:

\begin{equation}
  \langle r_i\vert r_j\rangle = \delta_{ij}
\end{equation}

where the Kronecker delta is:
\begin{equation}
  \delta_{ij} = \begin{cases}
    0 & ~\text{if}~ i \ne j\\
    1 & ~\text{if}~ i = j
                \end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\langle r_i\vert r_j\rangle = \delta_{ij}$ denotes taking the dot product between the two
vectors $\ket{r_i}$ and $\ket{r_j}$.

The basis states help to quantify the component of a state vector along that state. Take our example from \eqn{eqn:zeeman}, we can construct inner products of the overall state, $\ket{\psi}$ with $\ket{\alpha}$ and $\ket{\beta}$ to determine component of the basis states.
\begin{equation}
  \langle\alpha\vert\psi\rangle = c_1 \quad \langle\beta\vert\psi\rangle = c_2
\end{equation}

The outer product of the basis state, $\ket{r_n}$, for an N-spin system must satisfy:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{n=1}^{N} \ket{r_n}\bra{r_n} = \mathbb{1}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbb{1}$ is an N by N identity matrix.

When a second spin is introduced, the Hilbert space is extended to accommodate additional spin
states by taking the tensor product of the basis states


\begin{align}\label{eqn:2spinstates}
\ket{\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}} = \ket{\alpha_1} \otimes \ket{\alpha_2} = \begin{pmatrix}
  1\\
  0\\
  0\\
  0
\end{pmatrix} &
\ket{\alpha_{1}\beta_{2}} = \ket{\alpha_1} \otimes \ket{\beta_2} = \begin{pmatrix}
  0\\
  1\\
  0\\
  0
\end{pmatrix}\\
\ket{\beta_{1}\alpha_{2}} = \ket{\beta_1} \otimes \ket{\alpha_2} = \begin{pmatrix}
  0\\
  0\\
  1\\
  0
\end{pmatrix} &
\ket{\beta_{1}\beta_{2}} = \ket{\beta_1} \otimes \ket{\beta_2} = \begin{pmatrix}
  0\\
  0\\
  0\\
  1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
The subscripts indicate which spin we are reffering to, e.g. $\ket{\beta_1\alpha_2}$ means that
spin 1 is in the $\beta$ state and spin 2 is in the $\alpha$ state.

\subsubsection{Operators}

Operators act on states. To explain this, let's consider a generic operator $\hat{B}$ with eigenstates $\ket{\alpha}$ and $\ket{beta}$. When a state is acted upon by an operator it is denoted by:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{B}\ket{\alpha} = b\ket{\alpha}
\end{equation}

the same state is returned, multiplied by some scalar $b$, that is an eigenvalue of $\ket{\alpha}$
in the operator basis B.

The expectation value of an operator can be found by:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:expectation}
  \langle\hat{B}\rangle = \langle\alpha\vert\hat{B}\vert\alpha\rangle = b\langle\alpha\vert\alpha\rangle = b
\end{equation}

this returns the eigenvalue.

In NMR we use three operators to determine the projection of angular momentum along a specific axis, $\hat{I}_x$, $\hat{I}_y$, and $\hat{I}_z$. These are defined by the Pauli matrices multiplied by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$.

\begin{equation}
  \hat{I}_x=\frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1\\
    1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\quad
\hat{I}_y=\frac{\hbar}{2i}\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1\\
  -1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\quad
\hat{I}_z=\frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0\\
  0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

as an example, let's take the example from before of a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field
and see what happens if we were to project the $\ket{\alpha}$ state along the z-axis.
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:operators}
  \hat{I}_z\ket{\alpha} = \frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1\\
    1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  1\\
  0
\end{pmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
  1\\
  0
\end{pmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2}\ket{\alpha}
\end{equation}
We find that $\frac{\hbar}{2}$ is the eigenvalue of $\ket{\alpha}$ for the operator $\hat{I}_z$. For ease of handling in the following examples we will take $\hbar$ = 1.

We will now examine three more operators and explore how they act on states. They are the total square angular momentum, $\hat{I}^2$ and the two shift operators $\hat{I}^+$ and $\hat{I}^-$ defined as the following:

\begin{align}
  \hat{I}^2 =& \hat{I}_x^2 + \hat{I}_y^2 + \hat{I}_z^2\\
  \hat{I}^+ =& \hat{I}_x + i\hat{I}_y\\
  \hat{I}^- =& \hat{I}_x - i\hat{I}_y
\end{align}
They act on states according to:
\begin{align}
  \hat{I}^2\ket{I,m_I} =& I(I+1)\ket{I, m_I}\\
  \hat{I}^+\ket{I,m_I} =& \sqrt{(I(I+1)-m_I(m_I+1))}\ket{I,m_{I+1}}\\
  \hat{I}^-\ket{I,m_I} =& \sqrt{(I(I+1)-m_I(m_I-1))}\ket{I,m_{I-1}}
\end{align}
Using a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field as an example we'll let these operators act on the $\ket{\alpha}$ state
\begin{align}
  \hat{I}^2\ket{\alpha} =& \frac{3}{4}\ket{\alpha}\\
  \hat{I}^+\ket{\alpha} =& 0\\
  \hat{I}^-\ket{\alpha} =& \ket{\beta}\\
  \hat{I}^+\ket{\beta} =& \ket{\alpha}\\
  \hat{I}^-\ket{\beta} =& 0
\end{align}
As the '+' and '-' denote raising or lowering $m_I$ by 1


We can see if two operators commute by using the commutator which is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  [\hat{A},\hat{B}] = \hat{A}\hat{B} - \hat{B}\hat{A}
\end{equation}

If $[\hat{A},\hat{B}] = 0$ the operators are said to commute. The $\hat{I}_z$, $\hat{I}_z$ and $\hat{I}_z$
have cyclic commutation rules:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:commutator}
  [\hat{I}_x,\hat{I}_y] = i\hat{I}_z\\
  [\hat{I}_y,\hat{I}_z] = i\hat{I}_x\\
  [\hat{I}_x,\hat{I}_z] = i\hat{I}_y
\end{align}

These relationships are important in NMR as they help govern the rules for the rotations of spins.

\subsubsection{Superoperators}

Like states, that can be transformed by operators, we can define objects that act in a similar manner on operators. These objects are called superoperators.

To start, let's take a simple commutation superoperator, $\hat{\hat{A}}$, defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\hat{A}}\hat{B} = [\hat{A},\hat{B}] = \hat{A}\hat{B} - \hat{B}\hat{A}
\end{equation}
Applying it to operator $\hat{B}$ results in the commutation of $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$

In NMR, three rotational superoperators can be defined using the commutation superoperators from \eqn{eqn:operators}:
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\hat{R}}_x(\theta) = \text{exp}\{-i\hat{\hat{I}}_x\theta\}\quad\hat{\hat{R}}_y(\theta) = \text{exp}\{-i\hat{\hat{I}}_y\theta\}\quad\hat{\hat{R}}_z(\theta) = \text{exp}\{-i\hat{\hat{I}}_z\theta\}
\end{equation}

These are applied to to the angular momentum operators using the sandwich formula:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\hat{R}}_x(\theta)\hat{I}_z = \text{exp}\{-i\hat{\hat{I}}_x\theta\}\hat{I}_z\text{exp}\{+i\hat{\hat{I}}_x\theta\}
\end{equation}

The result of this is a rotation of $\hat{I}_z$ around the $x$-axis by an angle $\theta$:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\hat{R}}_x(\theta)\hat{I}_z = \cos{\theta}\hat{I}_z - \sin{\theta}\hat{I}_y
\end{equation}

The rotational direction (sign of the $\sin{\theta}$ term) is determined by the right hand co-ordinate system defined in \eqn{eqn:commutator}.

We will now discuss how these are used in describing the spin dynamics of a spin system.

\subsubsection{Density Operator}

The density operator gives us information on the state of groups of spins in a spin system.

Let's go back once again to a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. Where $\ket{\psi}$ is some superposition state in the two level system such that:
\begin{align}
\ket{\psi} =& \begin{pmatrix}
    c_1\\
    c_2
\end{pmatrix} = c_1\ket{\alpha} + c_2\ket{\beta}\\
\bra{\psi} =& \begin{pmatrix}
  c_1^* & c_2^*
\end{pmatrix} = c_1^*\bra{\alpha} + c_2^*\bra{\beta}
\end{align}

The density operator has the form:
\begin{equation}
  \hat\rho = \overline{\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}} = \begin{pmatrix}
    c_1c_1^* & c_1c_2^*\\
    c_2c_1^* & c_2c_2^*
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

If the number of spins is increased, the denstiy operator's form does not change instead it provides
an average fo the entire group of spin states. The population of a given state is given by the expectation value of the density operator as in \eqn{eqn:expectation}. If we would like to know
the population of state $\ket{\alpha}$ we would perform the following:
\begin{equation}
  \langle\alpha\vert\hat\rho\vert\alpha\rangle = \langle\alpha\vert\psi\rangle \langle\alpha\vert\psi\rangle = c_1^*c_1
\end{equation}

The diagonal elements of $\hat\rho$ are state populations or the probabilities of being in a certain state.

The off-diagonal elements are coherences between states. These coherences are complex numbers and two coherences between the same pair of states are complex cojugates of each other. e.g.:
\begin{equation}
  \langle\alpha\vert\hat\rho\vert\beta\rangle = (\langle\beta\vert\hat\rho\vert\alpha\rangle)^* = c_1c_2^* = (c_1^*c_2)^*
\end{equation}
The coherence order between two states in a magnetic field is defined as the difference in angular
momentum projection along the $z$ axis. In our two spin this would be(with $\hbar = 1$):
\begin{align}
  \hat{I}_z\ket{\beta} = m_\alpha = +\frac{1}{2}\ket{\alpha}\\
  \hat{I}_z\ket{\beta} = m_\beta = -\frac{1}{2}\ket{\beta}
\end{align}
We can use these results to calculate the coherence order of the coherence $\langle\alpha\vert\hat\rho\vert\beta\rangle$:
\begin{equation}
 m_\alpha - m_\beta = +1
\end{equation}
and conversely the coherence order of $\langle\beta\vert\hat\rho\vert\alpha\rangle$ is:
\begin{equation}
  m_\beta - m_\alpha = -1
\end{equation}

Now let's look at how $\hat\rho$ relates to the angular momentum operators give in \eqn{eqn:operators}.

Usually in NMR there are $>10^{20}$ spins in the sample, the density operator becomes more advantageous here
as mentioned it contains information about the entire spin ensemble. Normally, there is only a small population difference between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (see \ref{Population}),
but for this example let's imagine we have found a sufficiently strong enough field for a population difference of $0.1$. The density operator in this case would be:
\begin{equation}
  \hat\rho = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
    1 + 0.1 & 0\\
    0 & 1-0.1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
using the definition given in \eqn{eqn:operators} we can re-write this as
\begin{equation}
  \hat\rho = \frac{1}{2}\hat{\mathbb{1}} + 0.1\hat{I}_z
\end{equation}
$\hat{\mathbb{1}}$ is identity matrix and corresponds to no population difference between $\ket{\alpha}$ and $\ket{\beta}$.

$\hat{\mathbb{1}}$ is unaffected by rotations so can be ignored in the context of NMR
and so we write
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho} = 0.1\hat{I}_z
\end{equation}
to describe the $z$ magnetisation of our sample.

The density operator can also be used to to describe the evolution of a spin system under operations. If we applied a $90$ degree pulse along the $y$ axis, denoted using radians by $(\pi/2)_y$. That is the equivalent of propagating the initial density operator, $\rho_0$
under the rotation superoperator $\hat{\hat{R}}_y(\pi/2)$:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_1 = \hat{\hat{R}}_y(\frac{\pi}{2})\hat\rho_0 = \text{exp}\{-i(\frac{\pi}{2})\hat{\hat{I}}_y\}\hat{I}_z\text{exp}\{+i(\frac{\pi}{2})\hat{\hat{I}}_y\} = \hat{I}_x
\end{equation}
Now the magnetisation is in the $x$-axis it will begin to precess about the $z$-axis which using our notation is the equivalent of of propagating $\hat{I}_x$ ($\hat{\rho}_1$)
under $\hat{\hat{R}}_z(\omega t)$:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:propagate}
  \hat{\rho}_2 = \hat{\hat{R}}_z(\omega t)\hat{\rho}_1 =& \text{exp}\{-i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\}\hat{I}_x\text(exp)\{+i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\}\\
   =& \cos(\omega t)\hat{I}_x + \sin(\omega t)\hat{I}_y
\end{align}
where $\omega$ is the larmour frequency, and $t$ is time.

the $\text{exp}\{i\omega t\}$ is called a propagator, because it propagates the density operator in time.

The Hamiltonian, the energy operator, describes how the system evolves in time and uses progators, rotational superoperators and the density operator in order to do so.

\subsubsection{The Hamiltonian}\label{Hamiltonian}

As mentioned the Hamiltonian is the energy operator. It provides information on the enrgies of states in a system.

If we let $\ket{\psi_1}$ and $\ket{\psi_2}$ be eigenstates of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ then
\begin{align}
  \hat{H}\ket{\psi_1} = E_1\ket{\psi_1}\\
  \hat{H}\ket{\psi_2} = E_2\ket{\psi_2}
\end{align}

The Hamiltonian can also be expressed in matrix form:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \begin{pmatrix}
    E_1 & 0\\
    0 & E_2
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
If the Hamiltonian is written in the eigenbasis of the system its main diagonal correspond to state energies and it has values of $0$ everywhere else.

The evolution in time of a quantum system is described by the Schr\"odinger equation:
\begin{equation}
  i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\ket{\psi} = \hat{H}\ket{\psi}
\end{equation}
The $\hbar$ was included for completeness sake and will again be set to equal $1$.

In NMR we describe the dynamics of a system using the density operator evolution rather than the evolution of the states using
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\ket{\psi} = -i\hat{H}\ket{\psi}\\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\bra{\psi} = i\bra{\psi}\hat{H}
\end{align}

we can derive\citep{Neumann2018}:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\hat\rho\quad=&\quad \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}[\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}]\\
  =&\quad[\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\ket{\psi}]\bra{\psi} + \ket{\psi}[\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\bra{\psi}]\\
  =&\quad-i\hat{H}\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi} + i\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}
\end{align}
to give the relationship
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\hat\rho = -i[\hat{H},\hat\rho]
\end{equation}
this is called the Louisville von Neumann equation.

Returning to our spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. The Hamiltonian is initially
proportional to the $z$ angular momentum operator
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \omega\hat{I}_z
\end{equation}

where $\omega = -\gamma B_0$. In matrix form, in our original zeeman basis, the Hamiltonian is:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \begin{pmatrix}
+\frac{\omega}{2} & 0\\
0 & -\frac{\omega}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}\ket{\alpha} = +\frac{\omega}{2}\ket{\alpha}
\end{equation}

The density operator evolves under a Hamiltonian like so:
\begin{equation}
  \hat\rho(t) = \text{exp}\{-i\hat{H}t\}\hat\rho(0)\text{exp}\{+i\hat{H}t\}
\end{equation}

In \eqn{eqn:propagate}, we saw that the precession of a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field can be described using the rotation superoperator around the $z$-axis $\hat{\hat{R}}_z(\omega t)$. We know that for this system its analagous to $\hat{H} = \omega\hat{I}_4$.

If the density operator commutes with the Hamiltonian there is no evolution of the system
this can be seen more clearly using propagators with $\hat{H} = \omega\hat{I}_z$ and $\rho(0) = \hat{I}_z$
\begin{equation}
  \rho(t) = \text{exp}\{-i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\}\hat{I}_z\text{exp}\{+i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\} = \hat{I}_z
\end{equation}
If the density operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian it will evolve. To demostrate this we use $\hat{H} = \omega\hat{I}_z$ as before  however this time $\hat\rho(0) = \hat{I}_x$
\begin{equation}
  \hat\rho(t) = \text{exp}\{-i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\}\hat{I}_x\text{exp}\{+i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\} = \cos(\omega t)\hat{I}_x + \sin(\omega t)\hat{I}_y
\end{equation}
The Hamiltonian for multi-spin system is slightly more complicated. Consider a two spin
system $I_1$ and $I_2$ with $J$-coupling $J_{12}$ the Hamiltonian then becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \omega_1\hat{I}_1 + \omega_2\hat{I}_2 + 2\pi J_{12}\hat{\mathbf{I}}_1.\hat{\mathbf{I}}_2
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathbf{I}}_1.\hat{\mathbf{I}}_2 = \hat{I}_{1x}\hat{I}_{2x} + \hat{I}_{1y}\hat{I}_{2y} + \hat{I}_{1z}\hat{I}_{2z}$.
In matrix form in the zeeman basis this is:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
    +\omega_1 + \omega_2 + \pi J_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & +\omega_1 - \omega_2 - \pi J_{12} & 2\pi J_{12} & 0\\
    0 & 2\pi J_{12} & -\omega_1 + \omega_2 - \pi J_{12} & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -\omega_1 - \omega_2 - \pi J_{12}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The zeeman basis is no longer an eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian because the $J$-coupling
introduces off-diagonal terms. In practice, when $|\omega_1-\omega_2| >> 2\pi J_{12}$
these terms are ignored because the zeeman basis is approxiamely the eigen basis of the Hamiltonian. This is termed the secular approxiamation.

However, when this is not the case, the Hamiltonian requires diagonalisation which is beyond the scope of this introduction but will be addressed if needed in later chapters.

\section{Micro-NMR}\label{Micro-NMR}

All NMR experiments depend on two performance metrics: sensitivity and resolution. Sensitivity
here means the minimum number of spins needed to give a signal clearly above the noise. Resolution
quantifies how well different spins in the sample can be differentiated. These two properties
are often linked, by selecting a smaller sample it is possible to enhance resolution by detecting
a smaller portion of spins in the sample but this compromises sensitivity as the number of spins become more
limited.

 In NMR, the long life time of the nuclear spin states (minutes in some cases) contirbute to extremely
 narrow lines in the spectrum with resolutions of one part per billion regularly acheived in
 commercial systems.

 \subsection{Sensitivity}

 \subsubsection{Signal to noise ratio}


 Sensitivity in NMR at thermal equilibrium is always in short supply. In an NMR experiment the signal
 is proportional to the net magnetisation, $M_0$, of the sample\citep{webb2005nmr}:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Webb}
  M_0 = \frac{\gamma~h}{4\pi}(I(I+1))(P_{\alpha}-P_{\beta}) = N\gamma^2\hbar^2I(I+1)\frac{B_0}{3k_BT}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus,$\hbar$ is Plankc's constant $h$/2\pi, $P_{\alpha}-P_{\beta}$ is the population difference between zeeman energy levels seen in \ref{Population}, $B_0$ is the magnetic field, $N$ is
the number of spins per unit volume , $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. The magnetisation
and therefore signal depends on the population difference which at room temperature is on the order of $10^{-25}$J
which is much lower that the thermal energy of the system. From the equation, increasing $B_0$ would seem a
valid strategy and comparatively it can be, increasing from 14.1T to 23.5T can almost double the signal,
however even at 23.5T there is only a factor of ~$6\times10^{-6}$ in population difference. It's this
very small value that is responsible for the low sensitivity of NMR compared to other techniques.

Detection in NMR is typically done through the induction of a voltage in a coil that's close
to the precessing nuclear spins this is usually referred to as the sample coil. Unfortunately,
this coil also brings with it a type of interference, noise, analagous to the 'hiss' in the backgound
of radio it is produced mainly from thermal motion of electrons in the sample coil with some contribution from thermal
motion of ions in solution. The signal to noise ratio, SNR, is an important factor in NMR experiments if its too low
the signal will never be seen.

The SNR was formulated by Abragam\citep{Abragam:1961vg} and the analysis extended by Hoult and
Richards\citep{Hoult:1976dw} and is defined as the peak signal divided by the root mean square (rms) noise including the magnetisation from \eqn{eqn:Webb} we find\citep{vanBentum:2007fda}:
\begin{equation}
  \text{SNR} = \frac{k_0\frac{B_1}{i}V_s\omega_0\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}M}{F\sqrt{4k_BTR_{\text{noise}}\Delta~f}}
\end{equation}
where $k_0$ is a contant that accounts for spatial inhomogeneities in the $B_1$ field, $V_s$ is the sample volume,
$\omega_0$ is the larmour frequency, the factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ is introduced as the noise is rms noise. The
factor $B_1/i$ the magnetic field from the coil per unit current is defined as the coil sensitivity. The denominator is
the noise determined by the noise factor from the spectrometer ($F$) and the dissipative loses ($R_{\text{noise}}$) of
the coil, circuit and sample for the spectral bandwidth $\Delta~f$. T is the absolute temperature and $k_b$ is the
boltzmann constant.

In the same paper, Hoult and Richards introduced the principle of reciprocity for calculating the
sensitivity of the RF coil, This states that the signal received from a sample by a coil is proportional to the magnetic
field which would have been created in the sample if unit current were passed through the coil. Therefore the SNR is
directly proportional to the sensitivity of the coil, $B_1/i$. This can be seen if we define an
effective sample volume $V'_s = k_0V_s$ that is the volume in which $B_1$ is within 10\% of the maximum
value at the center of the coil. The SNR is given by a more simple expression\citep{vanBentum:2007fda}:
\begin{equation}
  SNR = C\frac{B_1N_s}{i\sqrt{R\Delta~f}}
\end{equation}
where $N_s$ is the number of spins in located within an effective volume $V'_s$.
For protons at 600MHz the constant, $C$ equals $1.4\times10^{-11}$ in SI units ($B_0$ = 14.1T, $T$ = 300K, $\gamma$ =
$0.2675\times10^9$ $\text{rad} \text{T}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}$, $I = 1/2$ and $F = 1$ assuming neglible noise from the spectrometer.)

From the simple expression it becomes clear that the way to improve SNR is to increase the filling factor
(optimize the number of spins in the number of spins in $B_1$), maximise coil sensitivity, $B_1/i$, and
minimise the total resistance. The filling factor, $\alpha_F$ is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:FillingFactor}
  \alpha_F = \frac{\int~B_1^2\rho(r)dV}{\int~B_1^2dV}
\end{equation}
where the function $\rho$ is unity in the sample area, and zero elsewhere. For a long solenoid coil with the
interior space filled with sample, $\alpha_F = 1/2$. Most other desings have a lower filling factor.

Two of these three can be solved by decreasing the size of the detector. The third, minimising resistance
can be tackled by commercially available cryoprobes where the coil is cooled with a stream of He gas to
~20K this reduces the thermal noise from the source and can increase SNR by a factor of four.

To see how size of coil affects SNR we take an RF helical coil. An idealised coil
is a cylindrical shell with uniform current density. The RF current penetrates to a frequency
specific depth $\delta$. For copper at 600 MHz and room temperature $\delta$ = 2.7 $\mu$m. The center
field is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{B_1}{i} = \frac{\mu_0}{\sqrt{l^2+d^2}}
\end{equation}
Resistance is:
\begin{equation}
  R = \rho\frac{\pi~d}{l\delta}
\end{equation}
with l, the height of the copper cylinder, d the diameter and $\rho$ the resistivity.
Optimum coil sensitivity is given by $d/l$ = $1$ in this case the signal to noise is:
\begin{equation}
  SNR = 0.9\times10^-16\frac{N_s}{d\sqrt{\delta~f}}
\end{equation}
For a fixed number of spins the SNR scales with 1/d as predicted by \citep{Hoult:1976dw}

\subsection{Limit of Detection}

The signal to noise ratio can be found in the time or frequency domain. In the time domain the noise, $N$, is
~$\sqrt{\Delta~f}$. Therefore the SNR in the time domain is not a good measure of sensitivity, it can be
artificially inflated by narrowing the bandwidth. Instead it is better to use \textit{limit of deteciton}, deined as
the number of spins that have to resonate within a bandwidth of 1 Hz to give an SNR of 3. This gives
the normalised limit of detection as\citep{Badilita:2011td}:
\begin{equation}
  \text{nLOD}_{t} = \frac{3n_s}{\text{SNR}_{t}\sqrt{\Delta~f}}
\end{equation}
Where $n_s$ is the number of spins that were present in the sample for the measurement and $\text{SNR}_t$ is the
signal to noise ratio in the time domain.
In the frequency domain, this becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:nLOD}
  \text{nLOD}_\omega = \frac{3n_s\sqrt{\Delta~t}}{\text{SNR}_\omega}
\end{equation}
here, $\Delta~t$ is the effective acquisition time for a single scan given by the inverse of the
line broadening applied in the processing of the spectrum.

Practically, NMR relies on signal averaging see \ref{Signal Averaging} to enhance the spectra, this
method requires waiting between scans for the spins to reach thermal equilibrium. In
this case the a better measure of sensitivity can be applied by using total measurement time
as $\Delta~t$. The drawback here, is that the limit of detection now depends on instrumentation
and sample as $T_1$ relaxation dictates the experiment repitition rate.

\subsection{Concentration limit of detection}

Both types of LOD discussed so far are absolute measures. It is often of more
interest to examine the \textit{concentration} limit of detection cLOD. This is given by
dividing the LOD by the sample volume:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cLOD}
  \text{cLOD} = \frac{\text{nLOD}}{\alpha_fV_c}
\end{equation}
Where $V_c$ is the volume of the coil and $\alpha_f$ is the filling factor defined in \eqn{eqn:FillingFactor}

One of the major reasons for development of micro-NMR has been the scaling of SNR and thefore LOD
with coil size. The trade off here is that as the coil size, and LOD, becomes lower and lower, the
volume shrinks too which leads to losses in cLOD. Micro-NMR therefore, only makes sense for mass

\subsection{Transmission line probe}

This work employs the use of a planar transmission line probe(TLP)\citep{Finch:2016gv, RN164}, in which the geometry
differs from that of a classic micro-coil. The design of which is based off early work by van Bentum \textit{et
al.} and for an equivalent helix gives $\sqrt{2}$ larger SNR\citep{vanBentum:2007fda}. The design of the TLP is shown in
\fig{fig:MVProbe}. It works with a generic microfluidic device that has well defined outer geometry and a fixed sample
chamber position.

  exploded view. Spacer (4) ensures the alignment of the sample chamber with the constrictions on the PCB planes. In A,
  PCB plane 5 is hidden to show the orientation of 1 with respect to PCB plane 3. Thickness of each of the PCB planes
  is 1.52 mm and the copper layers on the PCBs is 35 $\mu~\text{m}$. Both the microfluidic device and the spacer are made from
  PMMA and have thickness of 0.9 mm and 1 mm respectively. Figure reproduced from\citep{RN164}}

The main advantage of using this probe is the compatibility of the device with customisable chips allowing
a broad range of applications and enabling the marrying of practical NMR and some microfluidic capabilities which
few others allow\citep{RN165,RN166,RN167}. The limit of detection LOD for the TLP used is
1.4 nmol $\text{s}^{1/2}$ which comparitavely lower than detectors of a similar size and more similar to the LOD of
commercial cryo-probes mentioned previously. Where the probe is exceptional in terms of micro-detector is
the cLOD. Demonstrated in \fig{fig:cLOD}.

For this work, the goal is not only to combine NMR detection and microfluidics, clearly that has been done before. However,
it is the combination of these two in a way that does not comprimise in either. That, in an NMR sense, means nLODs
comparible to macroprobes as well as sub 0.01 ppm line widths for true spectral resoltuion. This is displayed in
\fig{fig:cLOD}, the area shaded orange that we define as the 'metabolomics feasible' range is a maximum 5 mM $\sqrt{\text{s}}$
ensuring species present at 0.1 mM can be detected within less than 20 mins to a sufficient resolution. The TLP has a cLOD of
~ 1 mM $\sqrt{\text{s}}$ and can detect species at 0.02 mM in that time frame Whilst this is suitable for some metabolomic information to be
gained, however, the subtle changes in molecules present at less than 0.02 mM still evades us in the given time frame. Efforts towards
lowering the nLOD and cLOD are described in \ref{Parahydrogen}
