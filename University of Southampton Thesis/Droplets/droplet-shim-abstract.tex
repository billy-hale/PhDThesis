A generic approach is presented that allows high-resolution NMR spectroscopy
of water/oil droplet emulsions in microfluidic devices.
Microfluidic NMR spectroscopy has recently made siginficant advances due to the
design of micro-detector systems and their successful integration with
microfluidic devices. Obtaining NMR spectra of droplet suspensions, however,
is complicated by the inevitable differences in magnetic susceptibility
between the chip material, the continuous phase, and the droplet phases.
This leads to broadening of the NMR resonance lines and results in
loss of spectral resolution.
We have mitigated the susceptibility difference between the continuous (oil) phase
and the chip material by incorporating appropriately designed air-filled
structures into the chip.
The susceptibilities of the continuous and droplet (aqueous) phases have been
matched by doping the droplet phase with a \ce{Eu^{3+}} complex.
Our results demonstrate that this leads to a proton line width in the droplet
phase of about 3~Hz, enabling high-resolution NMR techniques.
