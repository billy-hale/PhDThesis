\subsection{Peristaltics}



In \fig{fig:Micrographs}, micrographs of the chip outside the holders are shown with the valves
where one can see the fluid channels on opposing side of their respective layers. Also given,
is side by side comparison of the same valve (valve 2 in \fig{fig:Chip}) open (2) and closed
(3) one can see the 'ring' formed by the PDMS as it seals against the middle layer.



As well as 6 valves, the chips also have two separate liquid
circuits that can be connected externally by attaching tubes to the top of the 3D
holders as shown in \fig{fig:Chip}. The inner circuit on
the diagram contains the pumping network which can be
modified to pump around the internal circuit or the complete network, and an NMR
sensitive sample chamber where measurements are performed. The external circuit,
contains an identical sample chamber that helps to keep the relative
volumes of the two circuits similar. The chip is filled from the
‘bottom’ using the 4 small access holes at the top of the chip (\textbf{A}-\textbf{D}).
This then allows the valve network and pressurised air to be
on the top side of the chip. The challenge in the chip was to fit
all the liquid paths and valve network around the 4 large
holes in the top of the design which accommodate the screws
necessary to hold the device together, and seal against leaks of
both liquid and gas.


\subsubsection{Fourier Transform}

After applying an r.f. pulse, the resulting free induction decay (FID) measured is typically an exponentially decaying sinusoidal function.
The signal produced from this can be written generally as:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:signal}
  S(t) =& \sum_l s_l(t) \\
  s_l(t) =& a_l\text{exp}\{-(i\omega_l+\lambda_l)t\},
\end{align}
where $S(t)$ is the total signal from from the sample and $s_l$ are the signals from the individual spins. Each spin has an
amplitude, $a_l$, and an associated decay constant, $\lambda_l = T_2^{-1}$.

$S(t)$ is easy to evaluate and interpret if it originates from one spin or a group of spins precessing
at precisely the same frequency, however, if there are more spins in the sample processing at different frequencies
the FID becomes extremely hard to interpret on its own.

We can clear this picture up however by employing a Fourier transform. This converts the time-domain data
into the frequency-domain, such that the total signal in the frequency domain, $S(\Omega)$ is the sum of all individual spin signals resonating at the frequency, $S_l(\Omega)$:
\begin{equation}
  S(\Omega) = \sum_l S_l(\Omega).
\end{equation}
This allows us to clearly see which resonances are possessed by our spins in the sample. To
perform a Fourier transform we must do the following:
\begin{equation}
  S_l(\Omega) = \int_{0}^{\infty}s_l(t)\text{exp}\{-i\Omega t\}dt,
\end{equation}
and using \eqn{eqn:signal} can be rewritten:
\begin{equation}
  S_l(\Omega) = a_l\int_{0}^{\infty}\text{exp}\{(-i(\Omega+\Omega_l)+\lambda_l t\}dt,
\end{equation}
sometimes written more concisely as:
\begin{equation}
  S(\omega) = \mathcal{F}\{S(t)\}(\Omega),
\end{equation}
where $S(t)$ is the signal for the time domain (FID) and $S(\omega)$ is the signal in the frequency domain.

The Fourier transform of our general case is:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}\{S(t)\}(\omega) = a_l\frac{1}{\lambda_l + i(\omega - \omega_l)},
\end{equation}
which is Lorentzian function centered at $\omega_l$ with peak width parameter $\lambda_l$.

The NMR signal represented in the frequency domain is a spectrum. It is usually consists of many peaks
indicating different resonance frequencies of spins in the sample. In the next
section we will discuss chemical shift and J-coupling. Two additional effects that when combined
with Larmor frequencies already discussed form the NMR spectrum as we know it.

\subsection{Signal Averaging}\label{Signal Averaging}

In NMR, the total signal that emerges from the probe contains signal from the sample
under observation as well as uncontrolled random signals called noise. In NMR spectroscopy, the most dominant source of noise comes
from the thermal motions of the electrons
in the receiver coil. In order for the signal that originated from the sample to rise above the noise,
signal averaging must be employed. This works as the sum of two identical experiments is twice the signal
of the original individual experiment:
\begin{equation}
  s_\text{NMR}(1+2) = s_\text{NMR}(1) + s_\text{NMR}(2) = 2s_\text{NMR}(1)
\end{equation}
The key is that this relationship doesn't apply equally to the noise, as it is random. A suitable
definition of the noise amplitude in a single experiment is given by the root mean square (RMS) noise defined
as:
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_\text{noise} = \langle~s_{\text{noise}}(1)^2\rangle^{1/2}
\end{equation}
where the angle bracket indicates an average over all sampling points. The RMS noise is the same for two
experiments assuming the noise is stationary i.e. the noise doesn't change from one experiment to the next.
However this does not imply that the noise from two experiments has twice the value. Summed over the two experiments
the RMS noise takes the value:
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_\text{noise}(1+2) \cong \sqrt{2} \sigma_{\text{noise}}(1)
\end{equation}
Since the noise over two experiments increases by $\sqrt{2}$ but the signal doubles. Therefore the signal to noise
ratio over two experiments can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \text{SNR}(1+2) = \sqrt{2}\frac{s_{\text{NMR}}(1)}{\sigma_{\text{noise}}(1)}
\end{equation}
This can be extended to show the signal-to-noise over $N$ transients is a factor $\sqrt{N}$ larger than the
signal for a single transient. So by signal averaging over many scans the SNR can be increased.

In principle, this allows NMR signals that have a SNR less than one to be 'pulled out' of the noise. In reality, this is
time consuming as in order to repeat an experiment precisely it is essential to allow the spin system to
reach thermal equilibrium again. The different NMR experiments must therefore be separated by an interval
many times longer than $T_1$, which in some case can be several seconds. For example, if the SNR of the first
experiment is 0.1 clearly the signal will be buried in the noise. The SNR may be changed to 10:1 by signal averaging
over 10,000 scans. If each scan takes 1 second this amounts to 3 hours of instrument time which is long but
acceptable. However, if the SNR is 0.01 then it follows that 300 hours would now be needed which is not feasible.

In order for smaller signals to be detected, the amount of signal i.e. the amount of polarization in the sample,
needs to be increased this can be done by preparing the sample in a specific way and is referred to as
'hyperpolarization'.

The macroscopic observation of the nuclear magnetic dipole moment for the entire spin ensemble


is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \langle\overbar{\boldsymbol{\mu}}\rangle = Tr\{\hat{\rho}\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}\}
\end{equation}
This is not strictly an expectation value but rather the average contribution from each
ensemble member as denoted by the overbar. Denoted from now on by $\overbar{\boldsymbol{\mu}}$

Now let's look at how $\hat\rho$ relates to the angular momentum operators given in \eqn{eqn:operators}.

Usually in NMR there are $>10^{20}$ spins in the sample, the density operator becomes more advantageous here
as mentioned it contains information about the entire spin ensemble. Normally, there is only a small population difference between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ,
so for a general polarisation level, $p$, the density operator can be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \hat\rho = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
    1 + p & 0\\
    0 & 1 - p
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
using the definition given in \eqn{eqn:operators} we can re-write this as
\begin{equation}
  \hat\rho = \frac{1}{2}\hat{\mathbb{1}} + p\hat{I}_z
\end{equation}
$\hat{\mathbb{1}}$ is identity matrix and corresponds to no population difference between $\ket{\alpha}$ and $\ket{\beta}$.

$\hat{\mathbb{1}}$ is unaffected by rotations so can be ignored in the context of NMR
and so we write
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho} = p\hat{I}_z
\end{equation}
to describe the $z$ magnetisation of our sample.

The density operator can also be used to to describe the evolution of a spin system under operations. If we applied a $\pi/2$ degree pulse along the $y$ axis, denoted by $(\pi/2)_y$. That is the equivalent of propagating the initial density operator, $\rho_0$
under the rotation operator $\hat{R}_y(\pi/2)$ using the sandwich:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_1 = \hat{\hat{R}}_y(\frac{\pi}{2})\hat\rho_0 = \text{exp}\{-i(\frac{\pi}{2})\hat{\hat{I}}_y\}\hat{I}_z\text{exp}\{+i(\frac{\pi}{2})\hat{\hat{I}}_y\} = \hat{I}_x
\end{equation}
Now the magnetisation is in the $x$-axis it will begin to precess about the $z$-axis which using our notation is the equivalent of of propagating $\hat{I}_x$ ($\hat{\rho}_1$)
under $\hat{\hat{R}}_z(\omega t)$:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:propagate}
  \hat{\rho}_2 = \hat{\hat{R}}_z(\omega t)\hat{\rho}_1 =& \text{exp}\{-i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\}\hat{I}_x\text(exp)\{+i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\}\\
   =& \cos(\omega t)\hat{I}_x + \sin(\omega t)\hat{I}_y
\end{align}
where $\omega$ is the larmour frequency, and $t$ is time.

the $\text{exp}\{i\omega t\}$ is called a propagator, because it propagates the density operator in time.

The Hamiltonian, the energy operator, describes how the system evolves in time and uses progators, rotational superoperators and the density operator in order to do so.



In NMR we can  describe the dynamics of a system using the density operator evolution rather than the evolution of the states using
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\ket{\psi} = -i\hat{H}\ket{\psi}\\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\bra{\psi} = i\bra{\psi}\hat{H}
\end{align}

we can derive\citep{Neumann2018}:
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\hat\rho\quad=&\quad \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}[\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}]\\
  =&\quad[\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\ket{\psi}]\bra{\psi} + \ket{\psi}[\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\bra{\psi}]\\
  =&\quad-i\hat{H}\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi} + i\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}
\end{align}
to give the relationship
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\hat\rho = -i[\hat{H},\hat\rho]
\end{equation}
this is called the Liouville von Neumann equation.

Returning to our spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. The Hamiltonian is initially
proportional to the $z$ angular momentum operator
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \omega\hat{I}_z
\end{equation}

where $\omega = -\gamma B_0$. In matrix form, in our original zeeman basis, the Hamiltonian is:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \begin{pmatrix}
+\frac{\omega}{2} & 0\\
0 & -\frac{\omega}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H}\ket{\alpha} = +\frac{\omega}{2}\ket{\alpha}
\end{equation}

The density operator evolves under a Hamiltonian like so:
\begin{equation}
  \hat\rho(t) = \text{exp}\{-i\hat{H}t\}\hat\rho(0)\text{exp}\{+i\hat{H}t\}
\end{equation}

In \eqn{eqn:propagate}, we saw that the precession of a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field can be described using the rotation superoperator around the $z$-axis $\hat{\hat{R}}_z(\omega t)$. We know that for this system its analagous to $\hat{H} = \omega\hat{I}_z$.

If the density operator commutes with the Hamiltonian there is no evolution of the system.
This can be seen more clearly using propagators with $\hat{H} = \omega\hat{I}_z$ and $\rho(0) = \hat{I}_z$
\begin{equation}
  \rho(t) = \text{exp}\{-i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\}\hat{I}_z\text{exp}\{+i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\} = \hat{I}_z
\end{equation}
If the density operator does not commute with the Hamiltonian it will evolve. To demostrate this we use
$\hat{H} = \omega\hat{I}_z$ as before  however this time $\hat\rho(0) = \hat{I}_x$
\begin{equation}
  \hat\rho(t) = \text{exp}\{-i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\}\hat{I}_x\text{exp}\{+i\omega t\hat{\hat{I}}_z\} = \cos(\omega t)\hat{I}_x + \sin(\omega t)\hat{I}_y
\end{equation}
The Hamiltonian for multi-spin system is slightly more complicated. Consider a two spin
system $I_1$ and $I_2$ with $J$-coupling $J_{12}$ the Hamiltonian then becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \omega_1\hat{I}_1 + \omega_2\hat{I}_2 + 2\pi J_{12}\hat{\mathbf{I}}_1\cdot\hat{\mathbf{I}}_2
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathbf{I}}_1\cdot\hat{\mathbf{I}}_2 = \hat{I}_{1x}\hat{I}_{2x} + \hat{I}_{1y}\hat{I}_{2y} + \hat{I}_{1z}\hat{I}_{2z}$.
In matrix form in the zeeman basis this is:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
    +\omega_1 + \omega_2 + \pi J_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 & +\omega_1 - \omega_2 - \pi J_{12} & 2\pi J_{12} & 0\\
    0 & 2\pi J_{12} & -\omega_1 + \omega_2 - \pi J_{12} & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -\omega_1 - \omega_2 - \pi J_{12}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The zeeman basis is no longer an eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian because the $J$-coupling
introduces off-diagonal terms. In practice, when $|\omega_1-\omega_2| >> 2\pi J_{12}$
these terms are ignored because the zeeman basis is approxiamely the eigen basis of the Hamiltonian. This is termed the secular approxiamation.

However, when this is not the case, the Hamiltonian requires diagonalisation which is beyond the scope of this introduction.

\subsection{Classical NMR}

\subsubsection{Spin}

Atoms, often modelled as a clump of neutrons and protons at
the centre known as the nuceleus, surrounded by electrons, have a property reffered to as spin.

In fact, nuclear spin is an intrinsic property of the nucleus and can take half or whole
integer values, including $0$. In this thesis one spin- 1/2 nucleus, the proton ($\ce{^{1}H}$) will be discussed, with another spin-1/2 nucleus \ce{^{13}C} making
sparse appearences. Just like in this thesis, $\ce{^{13}C}$ only has an $\approx{1}\%$
abundance in nature with the other $\approx{99}\%$ $\ce{^{12}C}$ having a spin-$0$
nucleus.

All spin-1/2 nuclei possess a magnetic dipole moment and behave rather like small bar magnets in that, when placed in an external magnetic field they have a tendency to align
with the field. In NMR this external field is called $B_0$, and is orientated along the
$z$-axis.

\subsubsection{Population}\label{Population}

In a magnetic field, a spin-1/2 nucles has two energy levels with a separation that is proportional to the strength of the magentic field, a schematic is show in \fig{fig:EnergySplit}. We label these levels $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=5cm,keepaspectratio]{EigenStateLevel.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Energy level and $\Delta~E$ of the two energy levels for a spin-1/2 nucleus}
  \label{fig:EnergySplit}
\end{figure}

When measuring a group of spins, each spin can exist in either the $\alpha$ or $\beta$ state and overall
the spins have a slight preference for the lower energy state, $\alpha$. This preference can be quantified
by calculating the difference in populations ($P$) which at thermal equilibrium is governed by the
Boltzmann distribution:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Boltzmann}
  \frac{P_{\beta}}{P_{\alpha}} = \text{exp}\{\frac{-\Delta{E}}{k_B T}\}
\end{equation}

where $P_{\beta}/P_{\alpha}$ is the population ratio between the states, $k_B$ is Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The polarisation, $p$, of a system of
spin-1/2 nuclei is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Polarisation}
  p = \frac{P_\alpha - P_\beta}{P_\alpha + P_\beta}
\end{equation}

For a system in an NMR experiment which typically operates at 298$K$ and
a field of 14.1 T the polarisation level is circa $10^{-5}$ meaning That the spins are aligned weakly
in the same direction as the magnetic field. It is this small polarisation that gives rise to the NMR
signal and why NMR is famed for sensitivity issues. One possible solution to this, hyperpolarisation, will be described in a later chapter.

\subsubsection{Nuclear spin precession}

When placed in a magnetic field, the nuclei will precess around the axis of the field at a rate known as the larmour frequency defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:larmour}
  \omega_j^0 = -\gamma_jB_0
\end{equation}

where $\gamma_j$ is the gyromagnetic ratio for a nucleus, $j$. The gyromagnetic ratio is
typically $10$s of MHz T$^{-1}$ that give larmour frequencies in the $100$s of MHz in an NMR
experiment.

\subsubsection{Magnetisation as a vector}

The net magnetic moment of a spin ensemble can be modelled by a 3D vector that can rotates in space. The essence of this is shown in \fig{fig:VectorFig}. Magnetisation is intially taken to be orientated along the $z$-axis, this is called longitudinal magnetisation. It is then rotated into the $xy$-plane which is called transverse
magnetisation that then precesses about the $z$-axis.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{VectorFig.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Magnetisation shown as a vector in red, at equilibrium, is orientated on the $z$-axis. A $pi$/2
  pulse rotates the vector to the $xy$-plane where it begins to precess around the $z$-axis.}
  \label{fig:VectorFig}
\end{figure}

How this vector changes in a magnetic field is described using the Bloch equations\citep{Bloch:1946hk}. These are a group of differential equations that
describe how the magnetisation vector components evolve in time in the
presence of orthogonal magnetic fields.
\begin{align}\label{eqn:Bloch}
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=\quad\gamma(M_y(t)B_z(t)-M_z(t)B_y(t))\\
  \frac{dM_y(t)}{dt}\quad=\quad\gamma(M_z(t)B_x(t)-M_x(t)B_z(t))\\
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=\quad\gamma(M_x(t)B_y(t)-M_y(t)B_x(t))
\end{align}
where $M_a$ is the magnetisation vector component along the $a$-axis, $B_a$ is the
magnetic field along the $a$-axis, and $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio as described before.

In the case of processing magnetisation around the $z$-axis, here denoted $B_0$, the
Bloch equations can be written as
\begin{align}
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\gamma~B_0M_y(t)\\
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad-\gamma~B_0M_x(t)\\
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad0
\end{align}
these have the solutiion
\begin{align}
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\cos(\omega^0t)M_x(0) + \sin(\omega_0t)M_y(0)\\
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\cos(\omega^0t)M_y(0) + \sin(\omega_0t)M_x(0)\\
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad0
\end{align}
where $\omega^0$ is the larmour frequency from \eqn{eqn:larmour}.

\subsubsection{Pulses and rotating frame}

\subparagraph{Rotating frame}

The field, $B_0$, of a regular NMR experiment is many Tesla, giving precession
frequencies of hundreds of megahertz. These frequencies correspond to radio frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum. When considering these precessing spins
it can be useful to change from a static frame to a rotating frame of reference.

The general case is when the rotating frame is at frequency $\omega_{rot}$, in this
frame, the larmour frequency will appear to be ($\omega - \omega_{\text{rot}}pulses
)$. This is called the offset,$\Omega$ and is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \Omega = \omega -\omega_{\text{rot}}
\end{equation}

It follows from this, that if the apparent larmour frequency in the rotating frame is different from that in the static frame, it must also be the case that the apparent magnetic field in the rotating frame must be different from the applied
field. We can use \eqn{eqn:larmour} to compute the apparent magnetic field, $B^{\text{red}}_0$:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:redB}
  \Omega =& -\gamma~B^{\text{red}}_0\\
\text{hence}\quad~B^{\text{red}}_0 =& \frac{\Omega}{\gamma}
\end{align}
this apparent magnetic field in the rotating frame is called the reduced field, $B_{\text{red}}$.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=7cm, keepaspectratio]{B1Bred.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{In the rotating frame the effective field, $B_{\text{eff}}$, is the vector sum of the reduced field,
  $B_{\text{red}}$ and the $B_1$ field. $\theta$ is the tilt angle defined between $B_{\text{red}}$ and $B_{\text{eff}}$}
  \label{fig:BMag}
\end{figure}


\subparagraph{Pulses}

In NMR experiments, pulses are used to manipulate magnetisation in order to obtain a signal. A pulse can be
thought of as a magnetic field oscillating at the frequency of the rotating frame
applied in the $xy$-plane in order to induce procession of the magnetisation. This magnetic field is labelled $B_1$ and is much smaller in amplitude than $B_0$, the actual applied field.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SpinRelaxation.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \caption{A) A graphical representation used to describe a pulse sequence, the width and height of the block
  refer to the power and duration of pulse respectively, the line represents the acquisition of signal. B)(1) The
  magnetisation lies in equilibrium along the $z$-axis. (2)  The $\pi/2_y$ pulse rotates the magnetisation around the $y$-axis. (3) The magnetisation precesses in the $xy$-plane around the $z$-axis and returns to thermal equilibrium}
  \label{fig:Pulse}
\end{figure}

In the static frame, the magnetisation is processing around $B_0$ at the larmour frequncy, so a relatively weak $B_1$ applied along the $y$-axis, for example, would do little to peturb it, given the effective magnetic field, $B^{\text{eff}}_0$, is calculated by:
\begin{equation}
  B^{\text{eff}}_0 = \sqrt{(B_1)^2+(B_0)^2}
\end{equation}
the much larger $B_0$ dominates here, however, if we apply the $B_1$ in the rotating
frame this becomes
\begin{equation}
  B^{\text{eff}}_0 = \sqrt{(B_1)^2+(B^{\text{red}}_0)^2}
\end{equation}
and using \eqn{eqn:redB} as $\omega_{\text{rot}}\rightarrow\omega$, $\Omega\rightarrow0$ and $B^{red}_0\rightarrow0$ so by making the offset small, or zero, the effective field
then lies close to the $xy$-plane and so the magnetisation will be rotated down
from $z$ which is what we'd like to acheive for our experiments.

The key, is that although $B_0$ is much larger than $B_1$, we can still affect magnetisation using $B_1$ by making it oscillate close to the larmour frequency
this is the phenomena of resonance. The angle between $B^{\text{red}}_0$ and $B^{\text{eff}}$ is
called the tilt angle, $\theta$. It can be seen from \fig{fig:BMag} that:
\begin{equation}
\sin(\theta) = \frac{B_1}{B_{\text{eff}}}\qquad\cos(\theta) = \frac{B^{red}_0}{B_{\text{eff}}}\qquad\tan(\theta) = \frac{B_1}{B^{\text{red}}_0}
\end{equation}

These radio frequency (rf) pulses are useful because they can be used to address spins at a specific larmour
frequncy. By applying an rf pulse on resonance with $\ce{^1H}$ we can manipulate the magnetisation of the nuclei whislt not affecting other spins (e.g. $\ce{^13C}$) contained in the sample.

\subsubsection{Fourier Transform NMR}

In this section we will examine how we can produce an NMR spectrum from the magnetisation of a sample
using the rf pulses we introduced.

In NMR we use a pulse sequence to describe the intensity and duration of pulses used in an
experiment, shown in \fig{fig:Pulse}. The rf pulse, $B_1$, is a $\pi/2$ pulse in the $y$-axis, followed by a signal
acquisition. This pulse tips the magnetisation into the $xy$-plane, and if the pulse length is much less than the
precession period (we will assume so), the spins begin to precess freely around the $z$-axis at the larmour
frequency, $\omega_0$, until they return to the $z$-axis through a process described in \ref{Relaxation}.

In a usual NMR experiment the signal is inductively detected. The oscillation of the spins in the sample induces
a current in the pick-up coils around the sample, which is detected, amplified and transformed into a spectrum.
The resulting free induction decay (FID) is typically an exponentionally decaying sinusoidal function. The signal
produced from this can be written as:
\begin{align}\label{eqn:signal}
  S(t) =& \sum_l s_l(t) \\
  s_l(t) =& a_l\text{exp}\{-(i\omega_l+\lambda_l)t\} = a_l(\cos(\omega_lt) + i\sin(\omega_0t))\text{exp}\{-\lambda_l~t\}
\end{align}
where $S(t)$ is the total signal from from the sample and $s_l$ are the individual spins. Each spin has an amplitude, $a_l$, and an associated decay constant, $\lambda_l$. The nature of which will be discussed in \ref{Relaxation} section. Exponential to trigometric function conversion
is done according to Euler's formula: $\text{exp}\{ix\} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$.

$S(t)$ is easy to evaluate and interpret if it originates from one spin or a group of spins precessing
at precisely the same frequency, however, if there are more spins in the sample processing at different frequencies
the FID becomes extremely hard to interpret on its own.

We can clear this picture up however by employing a Fourier transform. This comverts the time-domain data
into the frequncy-domain, such that the total signal in the frequency domain, $S(\Omega)$ is the sum of all individual spin signals in the frequency, $S_l(\Omega)$:
\begin{equation}
  S(\Omega) = \sum_l S_l(\Omega)
\end{equation}
This allows us to clearly see which resonances are possessed by our spins in the sample. To
perform a Fourier transform we must do the following:
\begin{equation}
  S_l(\Omega) = \int_{0}^{\infty}s_l(t)\text{exp}\{-i\Omega t\}dt
\end{equation}
and using \eqn{eqn:signal} can be rewritten:
\begin{equation}
  S_l(\Omega) = a_l\int_{0}^{\infty}\text{exp}\{(-i(\Omega+\Omega_l)+\lambda_l t\}dt
\end{equation}
sometimes written more concisely as:
\begin{equation}
  S(\omega) = \mathcal{F}\{S(t)\}(\Omega)
\end{equation}
where $S(t)$ is the signal for the time domain (FID) and $S(\omega)$ is the signal in the frequency domain.

The Fourier transform of our general case is:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}\{S(t)\}(\omega) = a_l\frac{1}{\lambda_l + i(\omega - \omega_l)}
\end{equation}
which is Lorentzian function centered at $\omega_l$ with peak width parameter $\lambda_l$.

The NMR signal represented in the frequency domain is a spectrum. It is usually many peaks
indicating different resonance frequencies of spins in the sample. In the next
section we will discuss chemical shift and J-coupling. Two additional effects that when combined
with larmour frequencies already discussed forms the NMR spectrum as we know it.

\subsubsection{Chemical Shift and J-coupling}

In a molecule, nuclei are surrounded by clouds of electrons which can shield, or de-sheild, it
from the effects of the external field $B_0$.

The chemical shielding factor, $\sigma$, shifts the resonance frequency of the nuclear spin. We
can now include it in \eqn{eqn:larmour}:
\begin{equation}
  \omega_j^0 = -\gamma_jB_0(1-\sigma)
\end{equation}
this chemical shielding is specific to each nucleus in the molecule. It is possible
for two or more nuclei to share the same factor. We refer to these as being chemically equivalent.

The shielding is often around $10^-6$ for $\ce{^1H}$. When plotting and examining spectra
it is would not be useful to use absolute frequecies, as discussed they are regualarly in the hundreds of MHz,
whereas the differences in peaks might only be kHz or less. To combat this we use a relative frequency scale
called chemical shift, $\delta$, it is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \delta = \frac{\omega_j-\omega^\text{ref}_j}{\omega^\text{ref}_j}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_j$ is the precession frequency of the nucleus of interest, and $\omega^\text{ref}_j$ is the precession
frequency of a reference nuclei. $\delta$ is a dimentionless number, unaffected by magnetic field strength, it often
small compared to the size of the field and is reported in parts per million (ppm).

In addition to the external $B_0$ field, the nuclear spins are also affected by the magnetic fields generated
by neighboring spins. These magnetic fields are mediated by the electrons in the chemical bonds. This is refered to as
spin-spin couling or $J$-coupling and gives rise to peak splittings in spectra. These splittings, and therefore the values of $J$-couplings, range from a few Hz to a thousand Hz typically.

Both of these, $\sigma$ and $J$-couplings, are tensors this means they depend on the orientation of the molecule
and the spin with respect to the magetic field. In liquids, however, tumble rapidly compared to the timescale
of an NMR experiment. This averages the interactions resulting in a scalar quantity for each.

There are additional effects the nuclear spins experience, for example, dipole-dipole coupling which
is a through space spin-spin coupling, and quadrapole coupling where there are spins with >1/2 values
however, these are not relevant to this work.

\subsubsection{Relaxation}\label{Relaxation}

The last part needed to complete our classical understanding of NMR is relaxation. Relaxation is the process
of the spin returning to the thermal equilibrum. The thermal equilibrium of spin-1/2 nuclei in a
magnetic field is the bulk magnetisation vector pointing in the direction of the $B_0$ field.

In this system there are two forms of relaxation, $T_1$ and $T_2$. $T_1$ is the longitudal relaxation time
constant and $T_2$ is the transverse relaxation time constant the difference between them is shown in \fig{fig:t1t2}.
$T_1$ is the rate constant that governs the return of magnetisation to the $z$-axis from the $xy$-plane. $T_2$ on
the other hand is the time constant that governs the return of magnetisation to equilibrium in the $xy$-plane.
It is more accurate to say that $T_1$ is the relaxation rate constant for populations, and $T_2$ is the relaxation
rate constant coherences, in the density operator (discussed in \ref{Quantum}). But this is incompatible
with the classical description of NMR.

We can now complete the Bloch equations from \eqn{eqn:Bloch}:
\begin{align}
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\gamma(M_y(t)B_z(t)-M_z(t)B_y(t)) - \frac{M_x(t)}{T_2}\\
  \frac{dM_y(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\gamma(M_z(t)B_x(t)-M_x(t)B_z(t)) - \frac{M_y(t)}{T_2}\\
  \frac{dM_z(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad\gamma(M_x(t)B_y(t)-M_y(t)B_x(t)) - \frac{M_z(t)-M_0}{T_1}
\end{align}
in order to derive $M_{xy}$ we assume the following:
\begin{equation}
  M_{xy} = M_x + iM_y\qquad\text{and} B_{xy} = B_x + iB_y
\end{equation}
After some algebra we obtain:
\begin{align}
  \frac{dM_x(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad-i\gamma(M_{xy}(t)B_z(t)-M_z(t)B_{xy}(t)) - \frac{M_{xy}(t)}{T_2}\\
  \frac{dM_y(t)}{dt}\quad=&\quad~i~\frac{\gamma}{2}(M_{xy}(t)\overline{B_{xy}}(t)-\overline{M_{xy}}(t)B_z(t)) - \frac{M_y(t)}{T_2}\\
\end{align}
where $\overline{M_{xy}} = M_x - iM_y\qquad\text{and} \overline{B_{xy}} = B_x - iB_y$
solving these gives:
\begin{align}
  M_z(t) =& M_{z,\text{eq}} - (M_{z,\text{eq}}-M_z(0))\text{exp}\{\frac{-t}{T_1}\}\\
  M_{xy}(t) =& M_{xy}(0)\text{exp}\{\frac{-t}{T_2}\}
\end{align}

\end{figure}

Relaxation occurs when the spins exchange energy with their surroundings. They do
this when local magnetic fields, usually caused by the motion of surrounding molecules, oscillate
near the larmour frequency of the relaxing spin. These oscillating fields can be thought of
as local RF pulses we discussed earlier, the key difference is that they only affect a few spins
and not the sample as a whole. Essentially relaxation is an energy exchange between the
spins and the molecules surrounding them. This is the origin of the original name for longitudal
relaxation - spin-lattice relaxation.
